File: database

Module Documentation for database:
This module provides a simple `Database` class for managing a database connection state. It tracks whether a connection has been established using a boolean flag. The class offers methods to connect to the database and to check the current connection status. It serves as a foundational abstraction for connection management without implementing actual network or driver logic. This allows other components to depend on a consistent interface for connection state.

File: auth

Module Documentation for auth:
This module provides user authentication functionality by verifying credentials against a simple hardcoded rule. It depends on the `database` module to establish a connection before performing any authentication checks. If the database connection fails, authentication is immediately rejected. The actual credential validation is currently implemented as a placeholder, checking for a single predefined username and password combination. This structure allows the authentication logic to be separated from connection management while relying on the database module for connection state.

File: app

Module Documentation for app:
This module provides a command-line interface for user authentication. It prompts the user for a username and password, then delegates the credential validation to the `auth` module's `login_user` function. Based on the authentication result, it prints a corresponding success or failure message to the console. The module's sole responsibility is to handle user interaction and display the outcome, relying entirely on the `auth` module for the actual verification logic.
