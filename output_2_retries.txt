File: database

Module Documentation for database:
This module provides a `Database` class that tracks connection s
tate using a boolean flag. The class includes methods to set the connection status and to check the 
current state. It does not implement actual database communication or network operations.

File: layer1.parser

Module Documentation for layer1.parser:
The `layer1.parser` module provides the `ImportGraph` class
 for analyzing Python import dependencies within a project directory. It builds a directed graph (ed
ges: importer → imported) by scanning the filesystem to index local modules and parsing import state
ments via AST analysis, resolving them only to other locally indexed modules. The class can detect c
ircular dependencies, generate topological sort orders (handling cycles gracefully), and produce vis
ualizations that highlight cycles. It ignores `__pycache__` directories and empty `__init__.py` file
s during indexing.

File: layer2.schemas

Module Documentation for layer2.schemas:
This module defines a TypedDict schema for tracking the st
ate of a documentation generation process. The `AgentState` structure contains fields for the target
 file, its dependencies, retrieved code chunks, loaded dependency documentation, and a draft of the 
generated documentation. It also includes fields to manage a review status, such as approval flag, r
eviewer suggestions, and a retry counter. This schema serves as a passive data container to organize
 information flow between different stages of the documentation pipeline.

File: layer2.llmprovider

Module Documentation for layer2.llmprovider:
This module provides a concrete implementation for gen
erating text completions using the DeepSeek API via the OpenAI client library. It encapsulates the s
pecific configuration details, including the hardcoded API endpoint and model name. The implementati
on includes a placeholder comment indicating dummy behavior, suggesting the actual API call may be s
imulated or under development. Its primary responsibility is to centralize the DeepSeek-specific int
eraction logic within a single class interface.

File: auth

Module Documentation for auth:
This module provides a simple user authentication function. It depen
ds on the `database` module's `Database` class interface to create a connection. The function return
s `False` if the database connection check fails; otherwise, it performs a hardcoded credential chec
k for the username "admin" and password "password". The module manages its own `Database` instance a
nd connection lifecycle.

File: layer2.retriever

Module Documentation for layer2.retriever:
The `layer2.retriever` module extracts code chunks (func
tions and classes) from a specified Python file. It uses the file indexing capability of `layer1.par
ser`'s `ImportGraph` to locate the file within the project directory, employing a caching mechanism 
for performance. If the file is not found or contains a syntax error, it handles these cases by sett
ing the state's `code_chunks` to an empty list or the full source, respectively. The module operates
 by mutating the provided `AgentState` dictionary, directly updating its `code_chunks` key with the 
retrieved content.

File: layer2.reviewer

Module Documentation for layer2.reviewer:
This module implements an automated reviewer for AI-gener
ated module documentation. It constructs a detailed evaluation prompt using the source code, depende
ncies, and a documentation draft, then delegates the actual review to an LLM provider. The module pa
rses the LLM's structured JSON response to determine if the draft passes review and extracts actiona
ble suggestions. Its responsibility is to orchestrate this review process by preparing the context a
nd updating the shared `AgentState` with the outcome.



================================================================================
File: layer2.writer

Module Documentation for layer2.writer:
This module constructs a prompt and requests the generation
 of module-level documentation using the `layer2.llmprovider` interface. It formats the source code,
 dependencies, and any reviewer feedback into a structured instruction for the LLM. The prompt expli
citly directs the LLM to avoid re-documenting dependency functionality and to focus on the unique re
sponsibilities of the target module. The resulting LLM response is then stored as the final document
ation draft in the agent's state.



================================================================================
File: app

Module Documentation for app:
This module implements a command-line interface for a simple user aut
hentication flow. It prompts the user for credentials and passes them to an authentication function 
imported from the `auth` module. Based on the boolean result of this authentication check, it prints
 a corresponding success or failure message to the console. Its responsibility is to orchestrate thi
s user interaction and display the outcome.



================================================================================
File: layer2.orchestrator

Module Documentation for layer2.orchestrator:
This module defines the workflow for generating modul
e documentation by constructing a state graph that sequences the `layer2` components. It orchestrate
s the pipeline by first retrieving code, then writing a draft, and finally submitting it for review.
 The conditional routing logic in `review_router` determines whether to accept the draft, loop back 
for a rewrite (up to a maximum retry limit), or terminate the process. Its sole responsibility is to
 define this graph structure and its execution flow.
